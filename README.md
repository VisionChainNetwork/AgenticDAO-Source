# Novelty
Agentic DAO is not just a DAO with bots,  it’s a synergistic system where: Cognition (ElizaOS) is trusted through Identity (ETH DID) made actionable by ⚖ Governance (Agentic DAO) enforced by Consensus (Proof of Visibility - a Dynamic DAG Approach) - making it secure, fast, and scalable. This architecture aligns AI logic with smart contract rules to enable self-regulating, adaptive, composable autonomous organizations.

# Use Cases
- Decentralized AI governance
- Autonomous asset rebalancing
- Self-curated research DAOs
- Multi-agent orchestration

# Technology Stack
- Blockchain: Vision Chain (EVM + DAG consensus)
- Identity: ETH DID / EIP-1056 Registry
- Agents: ElizaOS Autonomous Agents
- DAO Logic: Custom Solidity Smart Contracts
- Event Handling: Smart Event Listener
- Delegation: DID-based Delegate Mechanism
